# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Hello and welcome to this project, it's still a work in progress but do enjoy yourself while you're here


Project Release: TBD

Task: Build an application solution for Med-Tech while implementing Web5.

Product Manager: Chisom Dom-Anyanwu
Designer: MEDICS5
Developers: Chukwubuike Victory Chime, Edidiong Harrison & Abasifreke umana Isaac
Reviewer: Chisom & Eddie
Version: Version 1 (MVP)

Project Overview:
Med-Chain is a revolutionary healthcare application that harnesses blockchain, front-end, and back-end technologies to establish a secure, transparent, and user-centric health ecosystem. This comprehensive solution addresses decentralized patient records, real-time health monitoring, and streamlined insurance claims through smart contracts.

Problem Statement:
Traditional healthcare systems lack transparency, security, and interoperability, leading to inefficiencies in patient data management, delayed insurance claims, and limited proactive health management.

Background and Research:
Extensive research revealed the shortcomings of existing healthcare systems, emphasizing the need for a secure and interoperable solution. web5 emerged as a viable solution for tamper-proof data storage, while wearables and IoT devices provided opportunities for real-time health monitoring...

Assumptions and Hypotheses:
Assuming that Web5 can address security concerns, wearables enhance real-time health tracking, and smart contracts expedite insurance claims, Med-Chain aims to revolutionize healthcare delivery.

User Survey Research:
User surveys highlighted concerns regarding data privacy, the desire for seamless healthcare experiences, and the need for faster insurance claim processing.

Key Insights:
Users value control over their health data, desire proactive health management, and prioritize quick and transparent insurance claim settlements.

Project Scope:
The project encompasses the development of a user-friendly application with decentralized patient records, real-time health monitoring, and smart contracts for insurance claims.

Actors and Channels:
Actors include patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. The application will be accessible through web and mobile channels.

Goals and Objectives:
Establish a secure and decentralized patient record system.
Enable real-time health monitoring through an intuitive frontend.
Implement smart contracts for automated and transparent insurance claims.

Deliverables:
Functional blockchain-based patient record system.
Intuitive frontend for health data input and monitoring.
Backend infrastructure for smart contract-enabled insurance claims.

Out of Scope:
Medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations are beyond the scope. The application doesn't replace professional medical advice.
